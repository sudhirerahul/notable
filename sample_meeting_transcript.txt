Product Planning Meeting - Q1 2026 Roadmap
Date: February 11, 2026
Attendees: Sarah (Product Manager), Mike (Engineering Lead), Alex (Designer), Jordan (Marketing)

[00:00] Sarah: Good morning everyone! Thanks for joining. Today we need to finalize our Q1 roadmap and assign action items. Let's start with the mobile app redesign.

[00:45] Alex: I've been working on the new UI mockups. I should have the final designs ready by Friday this week. Once approved, I'll need about two weeks to create the complete design system.

[01:20] Sarah: Perfect. Mike, can you review Alex's designs by next Monday and provide feedback?

[01:35] Mike: Sure, I'll block out time on Monday afternoon to review them thoroughly. I'll also need to set up the new development environment for the mobile team by end of this month.

[02:10] Sarah: Great. Jordan, what's the status on the marketing campaign?

[02:25] Jordan: We're almost done with the content calendar. I need to schedule a meeting with the social media team by next Wednesday to finalize the posting schedule. Also, I'll prepare the press release draft and send it to everyone for review by February 20th.

[03:00] Alex: For the design system, I'll need input from Mike's team. Can we schedule a design review session?

[03:15] Mike: How about next Thursday at 2 PM? That gives me time to review your initial designs first.

[03:30] Alex: Works for me. I'll send calendar invites today.

[04:00] Sarah: Excellent. Let me summarize the action items:
- Alex will complete the UI mockups by Friday
- Mike will review the designs by Monday and provide feedback
- Mike will set up the development environment by end of February
- Jordan will meet with social media team by next Wednesday
- Jordan will send press release draft by February 20th
- Alex will schedule design review for next Thursday at 2 PM

[04:45] Sarah: One more thing - we need someone to update the product roadmap document with these decisions. Mike, can you handle that?

[05:00] Mike: Yes, I'll update the roadmap doc and share it with the team by tomorrow end of day.

[05:15] Jordan: I also need to coordinate with the sales team about the new pricing tiers. I'll set up a meeting with them before the end of this week.

[05:40] Sarah: Perfect. Anything else before we wrap up?

[06:00] Alex: Just wanted to mention - I'll also need to conduct user research sessions for the new features. I'll schedule those for next week and compile findings by March 1st.

[06:30] Sarah: Great! Thanks everyone. Let's reconvene next Friday to check progress on all these items. Meeting adjourned.
