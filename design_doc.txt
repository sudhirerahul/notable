This document outlines the technical and experiential architecture of the **AI Meeting-to-Task Scheduler**, reimagined with the high-fidelity, minimalist aesthetics of the **Perplexity Comet** design language: deep obsidian backgrounds, ethereal neon accents, and streamlined data visualization.

## 1. Technical Specifications

### Conceptual System Architecture

The platform operates on a **distributed microservices architecture** optimized for high-concurrency LLM processing and real-time calendar synchronization.

* **Ingestion Service:** Handles secure transcript uploads and webhooks from Zoom/Teams.
* **Extraction Service:** Orchestrates LLM chains to parse unstructured text into structured JSON.
* **Scheduler Service:** A greedy-logic engine that interfaces with OAuth-protected calendars.
* **Infrastructure:** A **PostgreSQL** core for relational persistence, paired with **Redis** for the asynchronous job queue.

### Sequence Flow

The journey from raw audio to a booked calendar slot follows a strict asynchronous pipeline:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User] -->|Upload| B(API Gateway)
    B -->|Enqueue| C{Job Queue}
    C -->|Process| D[LLM Service]
    D -->|Store| E[(PostgreSQL)]
    E -->|Trigger| F[Scheduler]
    F -->|Sync| G[Calendar API]
    G -->|Notify| A

```

### API Definitions (The "Comet" Interface)

We provide a unified **GraphQL** endpoint for frontend agility and a **REST** layer for external integrations.

> **Mutation: Extract Tasks**
> ```graphql
> mutation {
>   extractTasks(input: { transcript: "...", title: "Q3 Strategy" }) {
>     tasks {
>       id
>       title
>       confidence
>       suggestedSlot
>     }
>   }
> }
> 
> ```

## 2. UI/UX Flow: The Obsidian Interface

The user experience centers on **transparency and control**, utilizing a dark-themed "Bento box" layout to categorize meeting insights.

1. **The Intake:** A drag-and-drop zone with a subtle "comet-tail" loading animation.
2. **The Review:** Tasks are presented as cards with **Dynamic Confidence Badges**:
* **High ():** Radiant Emerald.
* **Medium ():** Amber Glow.
* **Low ():** Crimson Pulse (requires manual verification).


3. **The Timeline:** A sidebar calendar view allowing users to drag "Proposed Tasks" into "Available Slots" with magnetic snapping.

## 3. LLM Extraction Logic

### Intelligent Chunking

To bypass context window limitations (e.g., GPT-4's token caps), we utilize a **Sliding Window with Overlap** strategy.

* **Window Size:** 2,000 tokens.
* **Overlap:** 200 tokens (to prevent task fragmentation).
* **Post-Process:** A recursive "Map-Reduce" step merges duplicate tasks identified across different chunks.

### Confidence Scoring

We calculate task reliability using token log-probabilities:



This mathematical grounding ensures the UI badges reflect actual model certainty.

## 4. Scheduling Algorithm: Greedy Optimization

The scheduler employs a **Priority-First Greedy Search** to find the optimal temporal fit.

1. **Sorting:** Tasks are sorted by  and .
2. **Gap Analysis:** The system identifies "Free Blocks" where .
3. **Constraint Logic:**
* **Soft Constraint:** Keep tasks within "Working Hours" (e.g., 09:00 - 17:00).
* **Hard Constraint:** No overlapping events.

## 5. Integration Ecosystem

| Integration | Protocol | Primary Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Google Calendar** | OAuth 2.0 / REST | `calendar.events.write` |
| **Slack** | Block Kit / Webhooks | `chat:write` |
| **Notion** | REST API | `pages.create` |
| **Linear** | GraphQL | `issueCreate` |

## 6. The Tech Stack: "Comet" Edition

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | React + Tailwind CSS | Ultra-fast, minimalist UI components. |
| **Backend** | Python (FastAPI) | Native support for AI/NLP libraries and async tasks. |
| **LLM Engine** | GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 | Industry-leading extraction and reasoning. |
| **Queue** | Celery + Redis | Handles long-running LLM calls without blocking the UI. |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (FE) + Fly.io (BE) | Global low-latency edge deployment. |
